                <p>Puerto Rico is a commonwealth territory of the United States. The tropical island is a popular tourist destination, while still having many of the same laws and customs familiar to mainland Americans.
                During my time in Puerto Rico I primarily studied in Spanish, but spoke a functional level of English due to both of my parents working (and frequently bringing me into) the nearby US military base of Fort Buchanan. 
                I remainedin PR for several years, until I was somewhere around 12 or 13, when I then moved to the mainland US, specifically to the State of Virginia.</p>

          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p>I like to consider myself a well rounded person with a variery of different interests and personal joys that I can share with others and use to better establish relations with patrons of various ages.
            Academically I am a student of history, languages, music, and a lover of the library ecosystem. All of these things only add to my love of helping others and seeing them get what they need with as little issue as possible.
          But aside from that, I try not to forget that there is more to life than just purely academic interests. I enjoy learning for the sake of learning, finding fun facts, learning lesser known stories and histories.
        All of these things fascinate me beyond compare, and I even find myself loving simpler things that others may overlook. I am a lover of the Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG) genre of entertainment.
       I like to listen to classical string orchestras now and again (ven viewing a live performance when one is available), though I don't have nearly as much time to actually play my old Viola as I used to.</p>

                <h1>Connections between personal interests and professional experiences. </h1>
                <p>Throughout the entirety of my life, I have found that there can be an overlap between the two sides of every person. The one we present at the office, and the one we present to those closer to us, and can find success in
                  doing so without crossing the line into impropriety. They can serve as learning experiences to undertand people, to interact with others, how to undertand and empathize with them.
                  The experiences that one has in their personal life can end up being an unexpected benefit to their career. They just need to be applied properly.
                  This is especially true for librarians who may be expected to interact with, and aid, people from all walks of life. </p>

            <article> 
                <h2>Understanding the connections, and making use of them.</h2>
                <p>Not everything can be transferred over from personal life to day to day operations of a library, but the lessons we learn from them can be very useful.
                  For this we need to pick out the experiences on an individual basis that can best inform us for situations in the future. But by applying lessons learned from
                  various hobbies, I feel that I can bring the same passion to my duties as I have experienced during leisure time. As many people have said, so long as you enjoy
                  what you do, you will never have to work a day in your life.

                    <ul>
                    <li>The small team building efforts of Tabletop Roleplaying Games helps a person to better work in a group for the overall benefit. Even though rolling dice and telling
                      stories together is now the same as managing a library and dealing with patrons. But it does allow for a level of experience when it comes to dynamically reacting to 
                      unforseen circumstances. It helps a person to be quick on their feet, and can help one to come to embrace newcomers with a sense of comraderie. It also brings with it
                      the added benefit of gaining a better understanding of the current cultural landscape, to understand what the younger generation of patrons are interested in and being
                      able to meet them at their level. This means that the library is better able to bridge the generational divide and help patrons associate libraries with a positive experience.  
                    </li>
                    <li>By having played in an orchestra, and understanding musical theory, it provided me with a way to understand how important it is to be part of a team and contribute as much
                      as I can without overshadowing others. Everyone working together in harmony allows a song to truly be great, and this idea can apply to any workplace, not just libraries. The 
                      very ideal of cooperation is what matters, but understanding it in practice is just as important.
                    </li>
                    <li>My volunteer efforts have given me a wide range of experiences in how academic and public libraries operate, and how different they can be. I feel that this has allowed me to 
                      better appreciate the library ecosystem in a few of its forms. The nuances of each individual library have to be taken on a case-by-case basis, and I feel I have a better grasp 
                    on that after volunteering for different libraries. </li>
                    <li>MY interest in the various different topics of the world, and what makes people who they are, works to provide me with an understanding of the human experience.
                      There is no one specific way to truly treat o interact with a nother person. But by understaning the wider diaspora of humanity, it helps to cut down on the chances
                      of a cultural faux pas. It also brings with it the added benefit of how best to empathize with others and meet them halfway. We must always understand, and recognize, 
                      that everyone is an individual, and yet also part of a greater whole that fills in their identity. 
                      I also feel that this wide ranging field of knowledge would help me to better provide for the needs of patrons who come seeking books on just about any subject realted
                      To the human experience from across the globe.

          <h2>Resume</h2>
          <p>I have been able to enjoy volunteering in many libraries over the course of my life, ranging from multiple summer programs at the Bull Run Public Library in Manassas VA, 
            to volunteering when possible at various High School libraries. When I wasn't doing that, I would help my father sell books online, or try to get a job at a used bookstore up in Mannassas.
          Looking back on all of this, it should really be no surprise that my heart belongs to the library discipline, and I feel most at home when in this kind of environment.</p>

                <li>While attending college, from 2016 (Associates Degree) to 2019 (Bachelor’s Degree) I worked 
                  independently from my home, selling used books online and to stores like McKay's used books 
                  for extra money for college on a part time basis. This endeavor also involved going to garage 
                  sales, thrift stores, and library book sales every other weekend in search of used books. I also 
                  resell textbooks online at sites like Ebay, Amazon, and Alibris among others.
                  I worked hard to produce a high level of productivity in order to ship customer orders in a timely 
                  and accurate manner. I would work hard in ensuring accurate shipping (figuring costs, best way 
                  to ship and pack certain items, etc.), as well as checking on the conditions of the books. I always 
                  strived to ensure my customers always received their books in the best possible condition. I 
                  would build and maintain a relationship with all clientele, whether it is a single sale or repeat 
                  customer. On a regular basis I would perform routine searches in software applications to ensure 
                  quality listings and identify items fitting a given criteria. On a regular basis I would update, 
                  manage and maintain, the Ebay, Amazon, Alibris and other selling accounts. Prior to purchasing 
                  any books, I would conduct research on individual, or specific, items to determine market value, 
                  evaluating based on applicable industry recognized criteria. I would do my best to accurately 
                  price items (setting reserved values) to sell in current market conditions. 
                  I managed the physical flow and storage of titles through the home shelf warehouse to the 
                  shipping box. I would safely store and label all incoming and outbound products (Books) from 
                  storage within my own home. I would maintain accurate shelving of items listed for auction or 
                  sale. I possess proficiency with a variety of software applications including, internet listing 
                  software, email applications, search engines, and specialized tools such as BookScouter.com. I 
                  possess familiarity with languages other than English, such as a fluency in Spanish and a basic 
                  understanding of Latin, which is very helpful when inspecting books on other related languages</li>
